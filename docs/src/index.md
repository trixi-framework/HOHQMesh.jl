# HOHQMesh.jl

This package is a Julia frontend to the Fortran-based *High Order Hex-Quad Mesher*
(a.k.a. [**HOHQMesh**](https://github.com/trixi-framework/HOHQMesh)) created and developed by
[David A. Kopriva](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~kopriva/). It augments HOHQMesh with
[interactive functionality](@ref InteractiveTool) that gives a user the ability to create, visualize,
and generate high-order meshes.
It further allows one to seamlessly integrate meshes generated by HOHQMesh into a Julia-based simulation workflow.
For example, running a simulation on an unstructured quadrilateral mesh
with [Trixi.jl](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/tutorials/hohqmesh_tutorial/).
HOHQMesh.jl is available on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

## Installation
If you have not yet installed Julia, please [follow the instructions for your
operating system](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/). HOHQMesh.jl works
with Julia v1.6 and above.

HOHQMesh.jl is a registered Julia package. Hence, you can install it by executing
the following commands in the Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("HOHQMesh")
```
HOHQMesh.jl depends on the binary distribution of the
[HOHQMesh](https://github.com/trixi-framework/HOHQMesh)
mesh generator, which is available via the Julia package
[HOHQMesh_jll.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/HOHQMesh_jll.jl)
and which is automatically installed as a dependency.

## Usage
In the Julia REPL, you can load HOHQMesh with
```julia
julia> using HOHQMesh
```
and then happily generate away!

Two 2D examples `GingerbreadMan` and `NACA0012` and a 3D example `Snake` (all
from HOHQMesh itself) come delivered with this package. You can generate a
mesh for them by executing
```julia
julia> control_file = joinpath(HOHQMesh.examples_dir(), "GingerbreadMan.control")

julia> output = generate_mesh(control_file)
```
You will then find the resulting output files (mesh, plot file, statistics) in
the designated output directory, which defaults to `out`. The
`GingerbreadMan.control` file will yield the following mesh,

while the 3D file `Snake.control` produces this mesh:

Examples scripts of interactive mesh generation tools are available in the
[examples/](https://github.com/trixi-framework/HOHQMesh.jl/tree/main/examples) subdirectory.
These example scripts are prefaced with the phrase `interactive_`.
There is a brief summary at the top of each `interactive` example script that describes
the mesh it will create and the features of HOHQMesh it uses.
An example script can be executed from a Julia REPL session with an `include(...)` statement, e.g.,
```julia
julia> include(joinpath(HOHQMesh.examples_dir(), "interactive_outer_box_two_circles.jl"))
```
The resulting output mesh and plot files are saved in the output directory `out` as
designated in the example script. Mesh statistics are printed to the screen.

The interactive functionality uses [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/)
to visualize the boundary curves and mesh from the interactive tool. A Makie backend, such as
[GLMakie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/GLMakie.jl/), can
be loaded in addition to HOHQMesh
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("GLMakie")
julia> using GLMakie
```
Now, running the example script produces a figure in addition to the mesh and plot
files that are saved and the output of mesh statistics to the screen.
