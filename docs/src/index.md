# HOHQMesh.jl

This package is a Julia frontend to the Fortran-based *High Order Hex-Quad Mesher*
(a.k.a. [**HOHQMesh**](https://github.com/trixi-framework/HOHQMesh)) created and developed by
[David A. Kopriva](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~kopriva/). It augments HOHQMesh with
[HQMTool](@ref) that gives a user the ability to interactively create and visualize high-order meshes.
It further allows one to seamlessly integrate meshes generated by HOHQMesh into a Julia-based simulation workflow.
For example, running a simulation on an unstructured quadrilateral mesh
with [Trixi.jl](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/tutorials/hohqmesh_tutorial/).
HOHQMesh.jl is available on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

## Installation
If you have not yet installed Julia, please [follow the instructions for your
operating system](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/). HOHQMesh.jl works
with Julia v1.6.

HOHQMesh.jl is a registered Julia package. Hence, you can install it by executing
the following commands in the Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("HOHQMesh")
```
HOHQMesh.jl depends on the binary distribution of the
[HOHQMesh](https://github.com/trixi-framework/HOHQMesh)
mesh generator, which is available via the Julia package
[HOHQMesh_jll.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/HOHQMesh_jll.jl)
and which is automatically installed as a dependency.

## Usage
In the Julia REPL, you can load HOHQMesh with
```julia
julia> using HOHQMesh
```
and then happily generate away!

Two 2D examples `GingerbreadMan` and `NACA0012` and a 3D example `Snake` (all
from HOHQMesh itself) come delivered with this package. You can generate a
mesh for them by executing
```julia
julia> control_file = joinpath(HOHQMesh.examples_dir(), "GingerbreadMan.control")

julia> output = generate_mesh(control_file)
```
You will then find the resulting output files (mesh, plot file, statistics) in
the designated output directory, which defaults to `out`. The
`GingerbreadMan.control` file will yield the following mesh,

while the 3D file `Snake.control` produces this mesh:
